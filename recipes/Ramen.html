    <ol>
        <h4>Heat the Stove Top:</h4>
            <li>Once water is boiling, add egg's and allow to boil to preferred texture, i.e. runny or firm. Once done remove from stove top and place allow to cool down.</li>
        <h4>Boil Noodles</h4>
            <li>I like to break noodle bricks in half then add to boiling water, and allow to cook until my desired texture. Once done, drain pot to around 1/16th of water and mix in seasoning packet's and your choice of condiments.</li>
